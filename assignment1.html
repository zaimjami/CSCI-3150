      <h2>Plot</h2>
      <p>Alisha "Al" Khanna, a 30-year-old yoga instructor in Mumbai, supports her unmotivated boyfriend Karan while struggling with anxiety and trauma from her mother’s suicide. Estranged from her father Vinod, she reconnects with her cousin Tia and Tia’s fiancé, Zain Oberoi, a real estate developer. Alisha and Zain begin a secret affair, intensifying as Alisha’s frustrations with Karan grow.</p>
      <p>Zain manipulates both women while his company faces investigation for fraud. Alisha becomes pregnant, while Tia unknowingly pledges her family’s property to save Zain’s firm. Zain sells it secretly, and tensions spiral. In a confrontation on his yacht, Zain dies accidentally. Alisha miscarries and is later blackmailed by Zain’s associate Jitesh.</p>
      <p>Tia later reveals Alisha’s true parentage: she is the daughter of Tia’s father Kumud and Sonali. This revelation reshapes Alisha’s estrangement from Vinod.
