      <article>
        <p>Alisha "Al" Khanna, a 30-year-old yoga instructor in Mumbai, is running a Yoga studio and developing a wellness app. 
        She supports her boyfriend Karan, an aspiring but unmotivated writer. Haunted by her mother’s suicide and estranged from her father, 
        Alisha feels unfulfilled.</p>
        <p>During a trip to her cousin Tia’s beach house, Alisha meets Tia’s fiancé Zain Oberoi, a wealthy real estate developer. 
        Despite being engaged, Zain flirts with Alisha, and they begin an affair. Their secret relationship intensifies, 
        while Alisha’s frustrations with Karan grow.</p>
        <p>As Zain’s business faces financial trouble, he manipulates Tia into pledging her family property. Alisha later discovers she is pregnant. 
        Zain’s deceit unravels, leading to a confrontation on his yacht where he accidentally falls, hits his head, and drowns. 
        Alisha returns home, suffers a miscarriage, and is later blackmailed by Zain’s associate Jitesh.</p>
        <p>Eventually, Alisha learns shocking truths about her parentage: she is the product of her mother’s affair with Tia’s father. 
        Reconnecting with her cousin years later, Alisha looks toward a more hopeful future despite the past’s traumas.</p>
