      <article class="flow">
        <p>Kabir proposes to Natasha and, at their engagement party, she learns he plans a three-week bachelor road trip to Spain with high-school friends Imran and Arjun. Each friend must choose one adventure sport for the group. Arjun—a work-obsessed stockbroker whose career cost him his engagement to Rohini—is reluctant. Imran intends to use the trip to find his biological father, the artist Salman Habib, in Spain.</p>
        <p>In Costa Brava the trio meet Laila, a British-Indian fashion design student and diving instructor. Kabir’s pick is deep-sea diving; Laila helps the aquaphobic Arjun overcome his fear, and they grow close. They celebrate La Tomatina in Buñol with Laila and her friend Nuria, and Natasha unexpectedly crashes the trip, suspicious of Kabir.</p>
        <p>Arjun’s choice is skydiving in Seville, forcing Imran to face his fear of heights. After a bar brawl lands them briefly in jail, Salman bails them out and gives Imran a candid account of why he left Imran’s mother. Imran recognizes his own mistakes—particularly with Arjun—and apologizes sincerely; their friendship heals. Kabir admits he isn’t ready for marriage.</p>
        <p>In Pamplona, they run with the bulls. The three make a pact: Imran will publish his poetry, Arjun will choose life with Laila, and Kabir will be honest with Natasha. As the credits roll, Arjun and Laila marry in Morocco, Kabir and Natasha part amicably, and the friends are renewed.</p>

      <h3 id="dev">Development</h3>
      <p>In November 2009, Zoya Akhtar and Reema Kagti completed a script initially titled <em>Running with the Bulls</em>, later finalized as <em>Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara</em>. Written around the theme of “three guys on the verge of commitments,” the part of Imran was conceived for Farhan Akhtar, who also wrote the dialogues. Poetry by Javed Akhtar is used as voice-over to deepen character interiority. Spain was selected over Mexico to authentically stage the San Fermín bull run climax.</p>

      <h3 id="casting">Casting</h3>
      <p>Farhan Akhtar was the first actor cast, followed by Hrithik Roshan and Abhay Deol. Katrina Kaif was chosen as Laila for her fit with a half-Indian, half-Caucasian, water-confident character; Kalki Koechlin joined as Natasha. Spanish actor Ariadna Cabrol played Nuria.</p>

      <h3 id="filming">Filming</h3>
      <p>Principal photography took place in the UK, Egypt, Mumbai, and in Spain—Barcelona, Pamplona, Buñol, and Andalusia. Cinematographer Carlos Catalan emphasized a warm, realistic look. The La Tomatina sequence required ~16 tons of tomatoes imported from Portugal; “Señorita” was filmed in Alájar with local participation. The bull-run finale was shot in Pamplona; final schedules concluded around December 2010.</p>
